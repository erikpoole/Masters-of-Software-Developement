/*
 * Implement the onInit and onDistanceMessage methods in the Router class of the code provided 
 * in this directory so that the routers use the Bellman Ford algorithm to compute routing information. 
 * Use the static methods in the Network class to help you with this. These methods shouldn't be more than ~20 lines of code or so!

Once you have a working implementation, test your algorithm on a variety of network sizes. 
Plot the number of messages required to converge as a function of network size. 
Since the networks are probablisitically generated, 
you might want to try several networks of each size to get a sense of the distribution.
