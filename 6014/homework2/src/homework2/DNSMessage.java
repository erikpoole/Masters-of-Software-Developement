/*
This corresponds to an entire DNS Message. It should contain:

the DNS Header
an array of questions
an array of answers
an array of "authority records" which we'll ignore
an array of "additional records" which we'll almost ignore
You should also store the the byte array containing the complete message in this class. 
You'll need it to handle the compression technique described above

It should have the following methods:

static DNSMessage decodeMessage(byte[] bytes)

String[] readDomainName(InputStream) --
read the pieces of a domain name starting from the current position of the input stream

String[] readDomainName(int firstByte) --
same, but used when there's compression and we need to find the domain from earlier in the message. 
This method should make a ByteArrayInputStream that starts at the specified byte and 
call the other version of this method

static DNSMessage buildResponse(DNSMessage request, DNSRecord[] answers) --
build a response based on the request and the answers you intend to send back.

byte[] toBytes() -- 
get the bytes to put in a packet and send back

static void writeDomainName(ByteArrayOutputStream, HashMap<String,Integer> domainLocations, String[] domainPieces) -- 
If this is the first time we've seen this domain name in the packet, 
write it using the DNS encoding (each segment of the domain prefixed with its length, 0 at the end), 
and add it to the hash map. Otherwise, write a back pointer to where the domain has been seen previously.

String octetsToString(String[] octets) -- 
join the pieces of a domain name with dots ([ "utah", "edu"] -> "utah.edu" )

String toString()
