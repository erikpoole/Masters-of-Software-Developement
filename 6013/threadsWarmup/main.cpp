/*
 Write equivalent programs using C++ + std::thread, and C + user level threads that:
 
 take as commandline parameters the number of thread pairs, and the number of iterations per thread
 start up the specified number of thread pairs (one starter + one finisher in each pair)
 join all the threads
 Benchmark the two implementations. Which is faster? Use a profiler (Instrument's time profiler is good) to explore what's happening when each program runs. Include a short description of your findings.
