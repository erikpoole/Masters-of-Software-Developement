Using the text editor that you installed in the previous lab, 
write an HTML web page that uses at least 15 different HTML tags.

You can view your web page as you're creating it by simply opening your html file in a browser.  
You can use the w3c validator to make sure you don't have any syntax errors: https://validator.w3.org/

Your HTML only webpage will be very boring looking.  
Spruce it up by add a CSS stylesheet to make it more interesting.  
Try experimenting with colors, fonts, borders, etc.

Commit/push your webpage to your github repo.   
Outside of your windows VM (on your mac), pull your changes from github and open your webpage in a browser.  
Are there any differences?
