Lab: Snooping the Web w/ curl & Wireshark -

What data are you sending to your partner? 
Arbitrary (but consistent) information was the same from both computers to the other
Values that changed were things like timestamp.  ICMP.

Did you see more than you expected in the output?  Can you figure out what other data was sent/received?
Yes, there were four HTTP packets but tons of TCP packets.

How are your results different/the same with curl?
Much more concise, only two HTTP packets and an order of magnitude less TCP packets.

Can you understand the output from wireshark when connecting to Github?  Why can you only read the first couple of messages?  
(Using Chrome & Safari) - “Change Cipher Spec, encrypted Handshake Message”. Https encryption occurs and provides “Encrypted Application Data”
