<!--
Create an empty html web page and an accompanying javascript file (loaded via  a <script> tag).

        Write "hello world" from Javascript, first using document.writeln(), second using console.log().  What's the difference?  Why would you want to use one or the other?
        
         
        
        Create an array literal containing a string, a boolean, an int, a floating point number, and an object.  
        
        Print your array, using console.log(), modify it somehow, then print it again.  Examine the console.  What do you notice?
        
         
        
        Define a function two add two parameters together.  First, use the more C++ style syntax:  function f(a, b){ ... }, then use the "function literal" syntax:  let myFunction = function(a, b){ ... }
        
        Which syntax do you prefer?  Can you detect any difference between the two ways of declaring functions?
        
        Test your functions using ints, floating point numbers, strings, and a mix of these.  What do you observe?
        
        Check your html + javascript files into your git repo.
